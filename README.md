## 🎯 About the Journey
A 90-day intensive learning path to transition into a Data Analyst role through hands-on projects with Hyderabad-specific datasets. This portfolio documents my daily progress, technical implementations, and business insights.

**Start Date:** February 2025  
**Goal:** Land a Data Analyst position in Hyderabad by May 2025  
**Current Focus:** Excel Mastery → SQL → Power BI → Python  
**Location:** Hyderabad, India

![Executive Dashboard](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/0D47A1/FFFFFF?text=Executive+Dashboard+Screenshot+Coming+Soon)

**Key Findings:**
- **29% increase** in total accidents over the decade, yet **fatality rate dropped** significantly, indicating better emergency response.
- **2020 Anomaly:** Despite the lowest accident volume due to lockdowns, the fatality rate spiked to its highest point (34.8%).
- **Severity Gap:** Post-COVID driving patterns show a shift in accident severity, requiring targeted behavioral interventions.

**Files:**
- `Day2_Accidents_Enhanced.xlsx` - Enhanced data with calculated metrics (Fatality Rate, YoY, Severity).
- `Executive_Dashboard.xlsx` - Interactive Excel Dashboard with Slicers.

## 📅 Daily Progress Log

### Day 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
**Date:** February 3, 2025 | **Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Focus:** Importing, cleaning, and preparing Hyderabad road accident data for analysis.

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned dataset with standardized formats.
- Data dictionary documenting transformations.
- Quality validation checks completed.

**Skills Practiced:** Data validation, standardization, documentation.

---

### Day 2: Excel Pivot Tables & Business Insights
**Date:** February 4, 2025 | **Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Focus:** Transforming raw data into interactive dashboards and actionable business insights for Hyderabad stakeholders.

#### 🔧 Technical Deliverables
- Enhanced the accident dataset with calculated metrics: `Fatality Rate %`, `YoY Change %`, `Severity Index`.
- Built 4 interactive Pivot Table analyses with connected Slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Created a consolidated "Executive Dashboard" in Excel for clear data storytelling.

#### 🎯 Key Business Insights
**1. Improved Safety Outcomes**
> "Despite a 29% rise in total accidents over the decade, the **Fatality Rate dropped from 34.4% to 28.1%**. This suggests improved emergency response and vehicle safety standards are saving more lives per incident."

**2. The 2020 Anomaly**
> "**2020 saw a sharp drop in accidents but a spike in Fatality Rate (34.8%)**. This critical pattern warns that reduced traffic density does not always mean safer roads; empty roads can lead to speeding and more fatal outcomes."

**3. The Severity Gap**
> "Accident intensity has shifted over time. We observed distinct changes in the Severity Index pre- and post-COVID, suggesting that driver behavior on open roads requires new safety strategies."

#### 📧 Stakeholder Communication
**Subject:** Urgent: Hyderabad Road Safety Insights (2014-2024)

Dear Traffic Police Commissioner and Road Safety Team,

I've analyzed Hyderabad's accident data (2014-2024) and identified critical patterns requiring immediate attention:

**Key Findings:**
1. **The Fatality Paradox**: While total accidents rose 29% over the decade, the fatality rate dropped from 34.4% to 28.1%—indicating improved emergency response is saving lives.
2. **The 2020 Warning**: Despite fewer accidents during lockdowns, 2020 had the highest fatality rate (34.8%). Empty roads likely enabled dangerous speeding.
3. **Behavioral Risk**: The intensity of accidents has shifted. We need to address the specific risks associated with post-pandemic driving patterns.

**Immediate Recommendations:**
- **Target High-Risk Zones**: Focus enforcement on areas with repeat severe accidents.
- **Time-Based Interventions**: Increase patrols during 18:00-21:00 peak hours.
- **Public Awareness Campaign**: Highlight the "empty roads ≠ safe roads" misconception.

I've prepared an interactive dashboard that identifies specific corridors and times for targeted intervention. Let's schedule a briefing to discuss deploying resources where they'll have maximum impact.

Sincerely,  
**Mangali Venkatesh**  
Data Analyst | Hyderabad
